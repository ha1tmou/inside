                <p>
                    <b>INSIDE</b> is a puzzle platform game developed and
                    published by PLAYDEAD in 2016. The player controls a boy
                    solving environmental puzzles presented as a 2.5D platform
                    game and avoiding death. It is the successor to Playdead's
                    2010 <b>Limbo</b>, with similar 2.5D gameplay
                </p>
                <h2>GamePlay</h2>
                <p>
                    The game is dark, with color used sparingly to highlight
                    both the player and certain part of the environment, the
                    game is mostly silent, with exception of occasional musical
                    cues, the boy's vocals, dogs barking, equipment and sound
                    effects. The player controls the boy who walks, runs, swims,
                    climbs, and uses objects to overcome obstacles and progress
                    in the game, the boy also gains the ability to control
                    bodies to complete certain puzzles and the boy can dies in
                    various ways, such as being shot or mauled by dogs, ensnared
                    by security machines, blown apart by shockwaves, or drown.
                    As in the predecessor game <b>Limbo</b>, these deaths are
                    presented realistically and are often graphic, but to a
                    larger degree.
